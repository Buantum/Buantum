I am a PhD candidate of quantum science and technology and my research interest is showed below.

1.Ultracold atoms and quantum simulation；

2.The application of [Non-markovian stochastic schordinger equation](stochastic_schordinger_equation.md)；

3.Many-body physics and strongly correlated system；

4.Open quantum system
